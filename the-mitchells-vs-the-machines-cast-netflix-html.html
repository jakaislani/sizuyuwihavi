The animated family movie is a great watch and has received favorable reviews and ratings from fans and critics alike.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The movie revolves around a road trip the Mitchells take to dropping their daughter off to her college, hoping to reconnect on the journey. Unfortunately, their plans are ruined as a product launch from Silicon valley giant Pal Labs goes horribly wrong, resulting in a worldwide robot uprising against the humans.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The Mitchells vs. The Machines features talented casts including Danny McBride, Abbi Jackson, Maya Rudolph, Beck Bennett, Eric Andre, and Conan O’Brien among others. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After the release of the movie, the cast have appeared in several interviews to talk about the movie and their characters. Here are some of the important things the voice actors said in the interviews.</p><h2>Social Media And Family Life</h2><p>One aspect that the movie touches upon heavily is the effect of social media on family life. Rick Mitchell, the father of the family, is averse to technology while Linda, the mother is obsessed with the idea of a picture perfect family that’s presented online so often.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Danny McBride, who voices Rick in the movie, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spoke</a> about technology and raising children to EW. He recounted the story of how the pandemic led to his son being unable to go to school or hang out with his friends to having a good time with his buddies playing Minecraft together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>McBride says watching it all unfold changed the way he viewed technology. “It’s not something we should keep them from. We should just understand how to make sure they’re using it in a way that’s adding to their lives and not distracting from it.”</p><p>Maya Rudolph, the voice actress for Linda, also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> her take on the subject. She said it was difficult to have a relationship with social media when you’re raising kids. She added it was the same for young people.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>An LGBTQ+ Hero</h2><p>Aside from painting the picture of a dysfunctional family navigating a turning point in their lives, The Mitchells vs. The Machines also introduces the first lesbian protagonist in a major studio animation film. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Director Michael Rianda <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spoke</a> to Thrillist about it, saying he wanted to clarify that Katie, the movie’s protagonist, was gay.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>We wanted to make it unambiguous. You have seen other movies where it’s wink-wink, nudge-nudge. It’s not a huge part of the movie, but it is in this movie. That’s who she is.</p><p>Rianda explained that the decision to have Katie be the character she is came about as they were striving to portray the Mitchells as a family as realistically as possible. Since queerness and different sexual orientations were normal in real life, they wanted to normalize it in animation. Especially since gay characters have had little screen time or presence in animated films.</p><p>Abbi Jacobson, the voice for Katie, also gave <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a nod</a> to the idea that there wasn’t a voice like Katie in the animation space. The real life struggles and self-discovery her character goes through adds that x-factor to sell Katie is a unique but very real character.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m1pnnMoqucoJWhubR51axkraCVYrqir8eipZ6rXZiutMCMp5ytnpyexW%2B006aj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vikas-aurora-md.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dr. Vikas Aurora, MD Grapevine, TX</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stained-glass-fall-leaves-with-template.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stained Glass Fall Leaves Craft (with template)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
