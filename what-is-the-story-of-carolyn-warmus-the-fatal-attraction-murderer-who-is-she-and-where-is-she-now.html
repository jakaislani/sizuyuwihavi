Even blonde like Close’s character Alex from the film, it wasn’t long before the tabloids dubbed Warmus The Fatal Attraction killer. Per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oxygen</a>, Warmus met Solomon in Westchester County as a school teacher, and the two quickly entered into an affair. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">crimelibrary.com</a>, Solomon was known for stepping outside the bounds of his marriage, and Warmus wasn’t the first. However, in this situation, things made a horrific turn.</p><p data-characters=623 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true>In 1989, Solomon met Warmus for a covert date, and he returned to his apartment to find that his wife, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Betty Jeanne Solomon</a>, had died from gunshot wounds. It took a year, but authorities closed in on Warmus as the murderer. On the night in question, Solomon left his wife, and authorities concluded that Warmus had gone to his apartment and killed Betty Jeanne. Warmus then met up with Solomon as planned, who was none the wiser. It would seem that with Solomon’s wife out of the picture, Warmus could be with her boyfriend in earnest. The opposite transpired. Solomon broke things off, and by 1990, Warmus was arrested.</p><h2 id=h-carolyn-warmus-inspired-many-reactions-in-the-media data-injectable=false>Carolyn Warmus inspired many reactions in the media</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/viriginia-madsen.png><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>The resulting trial of Warmus garnered widespread attention. In addition to the similarities of&nbsp;Fatal Attraction, evidence piled up against her to an alarming degree. Even though she stressed her innocence publicly, there was little doubt in the jury’s mind if she was guilty.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>&nbsp;reported that Warmus had bought a gun from private investigator Vincent Parco, the very same gun used in the murder. That and the apparent motive, the accused murderer, was a figure practically made for the tabloids.</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Hollywood seemed to think so, too, as a television movie quickly materialized. In 1992, ABC premiered A Murderous Affair: The Carolyn Warmus Story. The film boasted that it took its material from court transcripts, a far cry from the ripped-from-the-headlines content that Lifetime produces. Starring Virginia Madsen as the title character, The Carolyn Warmus Story cast many stars of the time, including Chris Sarandon and William H. Macy. But Warmus’ story was far from over.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>After 27 years in prison, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a> reported that the convicted killer was released in July 2019. She continued to advocate for her innocence by lobbying for DNA tests that could exonerate her, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lohud.com</a>. No <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DNA testing results</a> ever came about in the case, and Warmus remains a free woman regardless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1osCMoqpmrJiaerTAzquwZqeWYrCivs6lsKdlp5a%2FrsHSZquhnV2brrWty2aYrayilrC1tc6nZKatopmys7HRZq6hp12ewG6%2Fx55kmqaUYsSpsdGeZKKrXai1pnnNqK5o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cee-lo-green-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cee-Lo Green Net Worth: Music Career, Charity &amp;amp; Cars</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-gunn-confirming-hes-on-the-verge-of-casting-the-dcus-superman-inspires-last-minute-prayer-circles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Gunn confirming hes on the verge of casting the DCUs Superman inspires last-minute praye</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
