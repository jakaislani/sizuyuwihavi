The show’s success spawned The Lizzie McGuire Movie, which in turn gave us the awesome “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sing for me, Paolo</a>,” and we will always appreciate the coming-of-age show for launching <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hilary Duff</a></strong>’s career.</p><p data-characters=716 data-current-count=1046 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately for all of Lizzie’s fans, it’s unlikely we’ll see a continuation in the style of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">iCarly</a> anytime soon. A planned sequel series starring Lizzie and the gang as adults was announced by Disney Plus in August 2019, but any excitement we felt was short-lived. After showrunner and creator Terri Minsky left the project in early 2020, the series fell apart in pre-production. Duff complained on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> about not being able to give a realistic portrayal “of a 30-year-old’s journey to live under the ceiling of a PG rating.” Despite hoping the reboot could move over to the more adult-friendly Hulu, it was ultimately shelved. At least we got a virtual table read, which was nostalgic in itself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>Maybe a new show isn’t in the works.
