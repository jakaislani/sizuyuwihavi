Following an early career marked by bit parts and failed pilots, Perry rocketed to fame in the mid-1990s with the Emmy-nominated role of Chandler Bing on the smash sitcom Friends. He went on to star in movies like Fools Rush In and The Whole Nine Yards. Off-screen, the actor struggled with addiction for many years. Perry later attempted to replicate his sitcom success with Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and Go On, eventually finding a ratings hit with a revival of The Odd Couple. Never married nor a father, he died at age 54 in October 2023.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Matthew Langford Perry<br>BORN: August 19, 1969<br>DIED: October 28, 2023<br>BIRTHPLACE: Williamstown, Massachusetts<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Leo</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Childhood and Parents" data-anchor-id=childhood-and-parents class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Childhood and Parents</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Matthew Langford Perry was born on August 19, 1969, in Williamstown, Massachusetts. His actor father, John Bennett Perry, split up with his mother, Suzanne Langford, while Matthew was still an infant. He went to live with his mother in Ottawa, Canada. Suzanne served as press secretary to Canadian Prime Minister <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/pierre-trudeau data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pierre Truedeau" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Pierre Truedeau</a> and later remarried. Matthew’s stepfather was Keith Morrison, a correspondent for NBC’s Dateline program.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Matthew attended Rockcliffe Park Public School and became friends with fellow student <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/justin-trudeau data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Justin Trudeau" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Justin Trudeau</a>, the current prime minister of Canada. After moving to Los Angeles around the age of 15 to live with his father, Matthew enrolled at Buckley School. He graduated from the private school in 1987.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Growing up, Matthew developed two passions: playing tennis and acting. “Giving up tennis wasn’t really a decision I had to make,” he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.menshealth.com/trending-news/a19541708/man-to-man-matthew-perry/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Men’s Health" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told Men’s Health</a> in 2012. “I was a very good tennis player in Ottawa, Canada—nationally ranked when I was, like, 13. Then I moved to Los Angeles when I was 15, and everyone in L.A. just killed me. I was pretty great in Canada. Not so much in Los Angeles.” Unlike his tennis prospects, a career in acting would be a different story.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 title="Early Roles" data-anchor-id=early-roles class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Roles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Perry landed his first movie part while still in high school, a supporting role opposite star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/river-phoenix data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="River Phoenix" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">River Phoenix</a> in A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon (1988). Unfortunately, the film came and went without much notice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In September 1987, Perry starred in his first sitcom, Second Chance. The show had a fantastical premise with Kiel Martin starring as a man who dies and gets a chance to go back to mentor a younger version of himself (played by Perry). The show was later retooled, dropping Martin and focusing on the teenage misadventures of Perry’s character. Despite its new direction and new title, Boys Will Be Boys, the sitcom failed to attract enough of an audience to stay on the air.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the series ended, Perry landed a series of small parts and guest appearances on such programs as Empty Nest and Growing Pains. He also had a supporting role on the short-lived Valerie Bertinelli comedic vehicle Sydney in 1990. This same year, Perry gave a strong performance as Desi Arnaz Jr. in the television biopic Call Me Anna, about the life of actor Patty Duke.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Three years later, Perry tried again for sitcom success with Home Free. He starred as a young reporter who lives at home with his mother, his sister, and her two kids. After a few months, the series was cancelled. Perry was then cast in the pilot for LAX 2194, a futuristic look at an airport which never aired.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 title="Friends Fame" data-anchor-id=friends-fame class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Friends Fame</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Perry soon found the perfect project with a leading role in a new sitcom about a group of young men and women in New York City.

They banded together to renegotiate their contracts after Friends became a huge hit—a must-watch show for many Americans on Thursday nights. Each eventually earned $1 million per episode. Critics loved the show, too. Friends notched 62 Emmy Award nominations in its run, including Perry’s 2002 nod for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the later seasons of Friends, Chandler developed a romantic relationship with Monica.
