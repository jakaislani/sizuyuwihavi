The Denver singles, who were desperate to find their happily ever after, seemingly found fireworks on their wedding day and fans are wondering if the couple are still together — especially after a major cheating scandal was teased.</p><h2>Why Did the Experts Match Lauren and Orion on ‘MAFS’?</h2><p>Lauren works for the federal government as a budget officer and was looking for someone as “hopeful and faithful and crazy” as her. As for Orion, he was someone who wore his heart on his sleeve and wanted to find “everlasting love.”</p><p>The experts felt Lauren’s “loving and adventurous nature” would be a great match for Orion, who was “ready to dive into the depths of a relationship.”</p><h2>What Challenges Did Lauren and Orion Face?</h2><p>While the season 17 couple found fireworks at their wedding, by the honeymoon, the cracks started to show.</p><p>The pair got into their first major argument during the November 15 episode after Lauren joked about not understanding the significance behind the slur “redskin.”</p><p>“I don’t even know what ‘redskin’ means, honestly,” Lauren said before joking that she did because she just looked at his face, hinting at his sunburn. Despite Lauren apologizing, Orion took the statement harshly and admitted he was a “little heated” about the conversation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MAFS-LAUREN-AND-ORION.jpg><p>“Growing up, you know, what came from my elders and my mom was just, ‘You don’t say that,’ you know?” he explained to his wife. “You just don’t do it because it minimizes who you are. And then, you know, making a joke out of the pain, I would say my cultural background has a very different approach.”</p><p>Orion later asked Lauren during the November 22 episode about the last time she had sex over dinner, to which she replied, “Two months probably to the day.”</p><p>Orion was visibly uncomfortable before admitting the revelation “took sex off the table” for him.</p><p>“I’m at a point where I know what I’m worth, you know?” Orion replied. “And so with that, I just don’t want to hand myself out.”</p><p>The argument continued after the couple moved into their shared apartment during the December 6 episode. During a therapy session, Lauren asked Orion if he no longer wanted to be married to her after their conversation about intimacy.</p><p>“It’s just with everything that happened, everything that took place, I lost all romantic interest,” he admitted, leaving Lauren speechless.</p><p>Lauren took accountability for “putting him in the predicament” of losing romantic attraction, though she maintained she was still interested in continuing the marriage.</p><p>“But if you don’t feel like you have it in you to do it,” she concluded. “I don’t want to twist your arm. I don’t want to force you to stay with me.”</p><h2>Are ‘MAFS’ Stars Lauren and Orion Still Together?</h2><p>Lauren and Orion seemingly <a href=#>called it quits before Decision Day.</a></p><p>“There is no doubt that there is chemistry between us and when we are, you know, avoiding the big topics or trying to navigate around them,” he explained to Lauren during the December 6 episode. “Yes, I mean, everything is great. But there is no romance within me anymore.”</p><p>After taking time to himself after the honeymoon, Orion wanted to “follow through with wanting a divorce.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJopJqqop6ypXnArWSfoaKowW6%2FyKCfrWWRp7JuuMCuqZ6mXZa7pXnOq6Copl2owaq4y2arqJ%2BVqbWmvo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./official-logo-and-synopsis-revealed-for-disneys-haunted-mansion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Official logo and synopsis revealed for Disneys Haunted Mansion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jovelyn-gonzaga.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jovelyn Gonzaga</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
