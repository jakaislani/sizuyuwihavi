Pillman, nursing an injury, extended an invitation to his former tag team partner to discuss Austin's upcoming match against Bret Hart at Survivor Series. However, the atmosphere quickly shifted as Pillman, seemingly more aligned with Hart, began to express sentiments that didn't sit well with Austin. In the midst of what was intended to be a scripted beatdown, the intensity of the moment escalated beyond the usual boundaries of a staged performance. What many fans may not realize is that, despite the predetermined nature of the encounter, the impact was very real, especially when Austin attacked Pillman with the cane, as Austin revealed on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Steve Austin Show</a>. He said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I shanghaied Brian Pillman with that big right hand, kind of like a clothesline, I stomped a mudhole in his ass and walked it dry. I was working, but it was a damn near shoot because it had to be. I was wearing those heavy-ass, Hi-Tech Magnum boots, and I still wear them to this day, and those things have a damn sole on them. They're very, very comfortable, but I stomped the s–t out of him. I was stomping him. I was kicking him. I was beating him to death. If you watch that footage back, Brian was walking around with that cane and there was a brass duck head on top of that cane that you put your hand on. So when I took that baseball swing and hit him in his shin. And he had his leg bandaged up. There was some plastic wrapped around his shin, so I didn't break his shin, but the stick broke. The walking stick broke. And if you watch that footage back, watch that brass duck head, as I hit him in the leg, fly off right into the crowd. And I believe it hit the top of that metal barricade. And it damn near could have easily hurt somebody, but we got lucky that it didn't. And believe me, when I swung that damn walking stick, I was swinging for the fence. It broke off."</p><p>Once the segment concluded, Pillman, now legitimately injured, had to be swiftly taken backstage. Steve Austin, concerned for his friend and professional counterpart, visited Pillman to ensure he was okay.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/A-split-screen-of-Steve-Austin-and-Brian-Pillman.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Brian Pillman & Stone Cold's Friendship In Wrestling, Explained</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Brian Pillman and Steve Austin developed a close friendship in WCW before both men moved on to WWE, and their relationship lasted to the end.</span><h2 id=brian-pillman-returned-the-beating-to-steve-austin>Brian Pillman Returned The Beating To Steve Austin</h2><h3 id=it-was-the-worst-beating-stone-cold-ever-got>It Was The Worst Beating Stone Cold Ever Got</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/stone-cold-steve-austin-one-more-round-vest-wrestlemania-19-cropped-1.jpg><p>The saga between <a href=#>Brian Pillman and "Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> took an even more dramatic turn in a subsequent segment a while later. Pillman turned on Austin, seeking retribution for the earlier beatdown. Austin described the encounter, saying:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“If you will remember, a couple of weeks or a couple of months later, he turned the tides on me. And let me tell you something, mister, as bad and as hard as I was kicking the s–t out of him, he gave it to me and then some. He beat the flying s–t out of me. And I wasn't selling it and I knew I had it coming. And I knew there was going to be a receipt on that ass-whooping. And I didn't know how Brian was going to respond because it was weeks or months later. But when he beat the dog s–t out of me, I mean, that was one of the worst beatings I've ever had in my time in the business and that's a straight-up shoot. Brian was kicking the s–t out of me.”</p><p>Despite the intensity, Austin expressed admiration for Pillman's competitiveness and the thrill of their working relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJurtGimKdloJ65rbnAp2SbnZGpera8jKyrnq6VYq62v9OipWaen6d6s7HApWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vegetarian-tacos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>11 Best Vegetarian Tacos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miguel-angel-guerra.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miguel Angel Guerra</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
