But at the time, women’s sports were still generally treated as a novelty. It was largely through the efforts of King, who spearheaded the formation of a new tour and threatened to boycott tournaments, that the pay gap began closing between her colleagues and players on the men’s side.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Enter Riggs. A champion from the World War II era, Riggs derived little satisfaction from his subsequent office job, preferring to hustle opponents on the golf course and in the poker room. A return to the men’s senior tour scratched some of his competitive itches, but what he really craved was the spotlight and a microphone. He got both, and the Battle of the Sexes eventually got underway.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Read Their Biographies</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">After defeating Margaret Court, Riggs challenged King to “keep this sex thing going”</h2><img alt="margaret court speaks with bobby riggs as they stand next to each other, both wear athletic clothing, court holds a racquet down by her legs, riggs holds two racquets underneath one arm with his hands on his hips" title="Margaret Court speaks with Bobby Riggs, 1973" width=675 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/before-the-battle-richmond-virginia-australias-margaret-news-photo-1695135531.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Margaret Court and Bobby Riggs meet one month prior to their matchup that was dubbed the “Mother’s Day Massacre” after Riggs’ lopsided victory.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By early 1973, the 55-year-old Riggs was garnering some badly needed attention by slamming the quality of women’s tennis and demanding to face its top players. He was generally ignored by his targets, but that spring, he found a taker in Australian champion Margaret Court.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Court, then 30, was in the midst of a career that produced more Grand Slam singles titles than any other player in history until <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/novak-djokovic data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Novak Djokovic" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Novak Djokovic</a> tied her record this year. But Court was ill-prepared for her May 13, 1973, matchup with Riggs. Thrown off by the hustler’s assortment of lobs, drop shots, and other tricks, Court quickly unraveled en route to a 6-2, 6-1 rout that was dubbed the “Mother’s Day Massacre.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Flush in victory, Riggs immediately called out the opponent he preferred all along. “Now I want King bad,” he announced. “I’ll play her on clay, grass, wood, cement, marble, or roller skates... We got to keep this sex thing going. I’m a woman specialist now.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">King already had plenty on her plate, but she knew there was no choice if she hoped to maintain the hard-earned gains for women’s side. That July, the 29-year-old formally agreed to a $100,000, winner-take-all match with the sport’s reigning loudmouth.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">The Battle of the Sexes had plenty of spectacle</h2><img alt="billie jean king reaches for a low volley as bobby riggs runs left as he watches his opponent" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/billie-jean-king-reaches-for-a-low-volley-in-her-tennis-news-photo-1695133545.jpg title="Billie Jean King vs Bobby Riggs during the Battle of the Sexes on September 20, 1973" width=682 height=1024 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following a summer of campy trash talk—at one point, Riggs said, “I’ll tell you why I’ll win. She’s a woman, and they don’t have the emotional stability.”—the Battle of the Sexes was ready for prime time. On September 20, 1973, more than 30,000 fans filed into the Houston Astrodome—itself something of a novelty as the world’s first indoor, air-conditioned arena—with celebrities like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/salvador-dali data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Salvador Dalí" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Salvador Dalí</a> mingling with what appeared to be aliens wearing tuxedos.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Embracing the spectacle, King entered the playing court on a gold litter carried by four shirtless members of the Rice University track team, while Riggs arrived via rickshaw, flocked by his bevy of “Bobby’s bosom buddies.” They then exchanged pregame gifts: a baby pig for the chauvinist Riggs and a giant Sugar Daddy lollipop for King.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While the carnival-like atmosphere continued in the stands, King got down to business on the court. After falling behind early, she broke Riggs’ serve to pull even, then continued her onslaught from the baseline. Riggs, meanwhile, realized he would have to work harder than intended, and shed his Sugar Daddy jacket after three games. Furthermore, his usual grab bag of tricks was yielding nothing of substance, and he uncharacteristically double-faulted to hand the first set to his opponent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was more of the same in the second and third sets, with King wearing out the older Riggs in key points as her supporters celebrated in the stands. The outcome, while not as one-sided as the Mother’s Day Massacre, was nevertheless a decisive three-set victory for King: 6-4, 6-3, 6-3. Riggs demanded a rematch (which he never received) but was also unusually humble in defeat, conceding that he had underestimated King’s abilities.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">The match brought tennis to the forefront of the conversation</h2><img alt="billie jean king smiles and holds a large trophy as she stands above a crowd of people" title="Billie Jean King celebrates after winning the Battle of the Sexes" width=1500 height=1810 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/billie_jean_king_battle_of_the_sexes_1973_photo_bettmann_contributor_getty_images_515109170_resized.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Billie Jean King holds her trophy high after beating Bobby Riggs in their $100,000 winner-take-all “Battle of the Sexes” tennis match.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Decades later, the match remains a cultural touchstone as both a symbol of the anything-goes ’70s and a measuring stick for progress. That year, the U.S. Open became the first of the four Grand Slams to award equal prize money to its men’s and women’s champions, an act that was finally matched by the lone holdout, Wimbledon, in 2007.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The match has also had lasting endurance in pop culture, most notably the 2017 movie Battle of the Sexes, which starred <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/emma-stone data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emma Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Emma Stone</a> as King and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/steve-carell data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steve Carell" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Steve Carell</a> as Riggs.
