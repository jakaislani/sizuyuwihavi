"Yes and no. I don't necessarily go into a subject just because America is upset about it, because America changes every six weeks. We live in a society where issues are thrown up by the media and then they go away and there's another issue, so by the time you make a movie, the issue is gone.</p><p>"Something like Vietnam doesn't go away. Vietnam has haunted America. It's been its bastard stepchild since the '60s, and the people that try to deny it or ignore it are covering up America's soul. They're repressing the things that we did there, and as a result, we're going to make the same mistakes over and over again, whether it's in Panama or Iraq or any Third World intervention. People are going to get killed, mothers are going to lose their sons, unless we can come to terms with what we did there."</p><p>Stone leaned forward, speaking more quickly. "Between a million and 2 million Vietnamese died," he said. "Their suffering in comparison to 60,000 Americans who were killed is enormous. We have never, ever, given them the credit of that suffering. Mr. Clinton has renewed the sanctions against Vietnam; we continue to hate them, even though we rebuilt Germany and Japan after World War II, and those countries committed atrocities on an enormous scale. America has, somewhere in this Vietnamese conflict, lost its compassion. It's lost its ability to make up, to forgive, to reach across this gulf and shake the hand of an enemy and say, 'Let's be friends again.' If we could do that, it would be great for America's soul. This would be a better country." A society's concerns</p><p>Stone has been over this ground before. In a sense, what he's saying is like a political speech. In another sense, of course, there is truth in it. He has put his movies where his mouth is, avoiding the obvious commercial formula plots to work on the demons that haunt him and, he believes, his country.</p><p>"There's a great line in 'Wall Street,' " he said. "You look in the abyss and that's where you find your character. I think that a lot of my character has come from defiance and rebellion, from the get-go, as a kid, in school. Whatever formed me was coming out of that. I did my homework, but I was a quiet rebel and I blew up and went to Vietnam twice and I became another person. So defiance has worked for me. That's my character.</p><p>"But to be misunderstood constantly is hurtful to me. I've been characterized as an angry Vietnam veteran. I've been characterized as a conspiracy nut, a buff, which is insulting. I've been characterized constantly as a man who can't get his head out of the '60s. These are simplifications, and they hurt me because it's not me. I live in 3-D and I'm passionate about so much. I hate to be simplified."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmoqakmr%2B3tcSwqminnJ7Dpr6MrKuoppVisLC6wqWsnZ2jYrWqv4yvoJ6snpa6bsDRoqOon6k%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pachi-jimin-net-worth-315253.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pachi Jimin Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./seyi-tinubu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Seyi Tinubus biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
