This is seen by a Nazi officer as an efficient way to undermine Merrin's belief in his own goodness, and indeed forces the priest to commit evil to avoid greater evil. This is not theologically sound; the idea is to do no evil and leave it to God to sort out the consequences.</p><p>His trauma from this experience hurls Merrin out of the priesthood and into an archeological dig in Africa, where he is helping to excavate a remarkably well-preserved church, buried in the sand. Why this church, in this place? It doesn't fit in architectural, historical or religious terms, and seems intended not so much to celebrate God as to trap something unspeakably evil that lies beneath it.</p><p>Schrader is famously a director of moral values crossed with dangerous choices; his own movies ("Hard Core," "<a href=#>Light Sleeper</a>," "The Comfort of Strangers") and those he has written for <a href=#>Martin Scorsese</a> ("<a href=#>Taxi Driver</a>," "<a href=#>Raging Bull</a>") deal with men obsessed with guilt and sin. His "Dominion" is not content to simply raise the curtain on William Friedkin's classic "<a href=#>The Exorcist</a>" (1974) but is more ambitious: It wants to observe the ways Satan seduces man.</p><p>The film's battle between good and evil involves everyone on the dig, notably the young priest Father Francis (<a href=#>Gabriel Mann</a>), who has been assigned by Rome to keep an eye on Merrin. Then there is the doctor Rachel (<a href=#>Clara Bellar</a>), whose special concern is a deformed young man named Cheche (<a href=#>Billy Crawford</a>). Curiously, Cheche seems to improve beyond all expectations of medicine, as if something supernatural were going on. Also on the site, in "British East Africa," is the Sergeant-Major (<a href=#>Ralph Brown</a>), a racist who assigns the devil's doings to the local Africans.</p><p>In a lesser movie, there would be humid goings-on at the camp, and a spectacular showdown between the humans and special effects. Not in the Schrader version, which trusts evil to be intrinsically fascinating and not in need of f/x enhancement. His vision, however, was not the one the powers at Morgan Creek were looking for (although Schrader was filming a script by <a href=#>Caleb Carr</a> and <a href=#>William Wisher</a> Jr. that the producers presumably approved). After Schrader delivered his version, a scenario developed that is, I think, unprecedented in modern movie history. The studio, having spent millions on the Schrader version, hired the director <a href=#>Renny Harlin</a> to spend more millions remaking it in a presumably more commercial fashion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46dpqahnp68r3nPq5yqrZWherW7jK2fnmWVrbyzr8isq2ZqYGWC</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiffany-smiley-husband-scott-smiley-was-blinded.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tiffany Smiley Husband Scott Smiley Was Blinded In Iran Age Bio And Children</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dan-aykroyd-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dan Aykroyd Net Worth : Career &amp;amp; Investment</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
