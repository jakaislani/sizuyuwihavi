It will also serve as something of a calm before the storm, or in this case, an absolute hurricane.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>No two women could possibly be as different as Sam and Kat; Sam’s intelligence and responsibility far outweigh Kat’s embarrassing immaturity.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Truth is that both Sam and Kat are full of sh**, but for totally different reasons. We knew going into tonight’s episode that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam has been constipated for nine days</a>, and would need to go home if she didn’t poop in time, per doctor’s orders. Apparently, being in familiar surroundings can help the poopless among us spring a welcomed leak, not to mention that the relief of stress can relieve our bowels.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true><br>And so it was that Sam was unable to properly discharge, and thus got discharged from the show as she said goodbye to everyone, including Aaron S., who was her best connection. It was a crappy reason to have to leave, but we hope Sam’s current problem has a healthy outcome — especially considering how well she handled everything. There’s a reason why every guy there was enamored with her emotional maturity.</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=50 data-injectable=false>Unlike Sam, however, Kat absolutely lost her sh**.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>After the notes from the Paradise truth box were read, Hurricane Kat was none too pleased about others being none too pleased about her Brayden brush off. Thankfully, Brayden begins to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gets to know Rachel instead</a>. Aaron S., still reeling from Sam’s departure, told Kat how she did Brayden wrong, and Kat not only didn’t care, she did her own version of Sam by not giving a sh**.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>“there’s a reason aaron s is single at 33”</p><p>“i’m respectful!”</p><p>in the same sentence feels wrong… kat is truly INSANEE<a href=#>#bachelorinparadise</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aRRP7ofKm3</a></p>— The Morning Bach (@TheMorningBach) <a href=#>October 20, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>At least, that’s what she claimed. Of course, she also told Aaron S. that something must be wrong with him because he’s a single man who is 33 years old. Worth noting that Kat is 27, and if she continues with spreading her insanity, she may find herself single long beyond 33.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Kat then took to the confessional, and proved her claims of not caring to be no more than lies, as she screamed for about three minutes straight at the camera, while complaining about every man on the beach. In fact, her rant was so loud that everyone there heard it. She then bolted down to the bar to get a drink.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I need Brooklyn to come back and drag Kat again.

A preview of Kat’s upcoming chaotic craziness shocked the Bachelor world, causing viewers to look away while not really looking away to quickly double-check that next week’s episode will be on at the same time.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>Social media lit up like Snoop Dogg decorating a Christmas tree, as Bachelor fans nationwide didn’t hold back their reactions. We were all warned by Brooklyn about Kat’s craziness, and how interesting it is that Brooklyn was no longer there to witness it all?</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Kat, who once was the happy rose recipient of Brayden before ditching him as soon as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanner landed on the shore</a>, will have Tanner ditch her in similar fashion in an upcoming episode. Perhaps not too similar, however, considering Tanner carries respect for others, while Kat straight up brutally ignored Brayden at one point, and played the victim thereafter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kat: “I don’t care”</p><p>also Kat: <a href=#>#BachelorInParadise</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UFXk8lQNHQ</a></p>— MoodieforBach (@MoodieforBach) <a href=#>October 20, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Truth is, there’s nothing wrong with moving on to another date on the show but, unlike Brayden, Kat can’t handle it. Tanner accepts a date from a new arrival and, to make matters worse, it all happens on Kat’s birthday. No way!<br></p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Suddenly, we see Kat turned into a spoiled child, crying about the birthday betrayal and when the other beach goers present her with a birthday cake, she appears to take it and toss it into the ocean.<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>With emotions running wild and utter disorder slamming the waves of Bachelor beach like a hurricane, we are suddenly struck with a cliffhanger. What happens next? Just how crazy will Kat go? How will <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the other contestants</a> react? Is her birthday cake still edible after being dipped into the ocean?</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>One thing seems appropriate though, which is that the extremely amazing Sam didn’t have to be there for any of it. Her respectful ways are in direct contrast to Kat’s, and her unfortunate predicament saved her from the wrath of Kat, which is something we might all need to be saved from if we dare keep watching this unhinged sh** show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y2usuiop5lo5a6brTUq6mim5Gjsm63wK2qZpqimsSqusZmmGarpKS%2FrnnOp2SbmZOdsq270Wagp2Wglr%2BisMisnGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./battle-of-the-sexes-true-story-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Billie Jean King Made Sports History at the Battle of the Sexes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./spooky-easy-ghost-treats-halloween-recipe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Spooky Easy Ghost Treats - Mom On Timeout</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
