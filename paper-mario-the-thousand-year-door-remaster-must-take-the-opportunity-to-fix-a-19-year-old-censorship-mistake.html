With this remake in particular, Nintendo has a chance to fix an almost 20-year-old censorship mistake – involving Vivian.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>Nintendo made the announcement in its September Direct presentation – along with a trailer showcasing “enhanced graphics.” This genre-bending 2004 game mixed platforming with traditional role playing elements (like turn-based battling) to create something perennially unique.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>The plot involves Mario finding some crystals to open an old door so he can save Peach. It’s a Mario game, so it’s more about the adventure anyway. Vivian, however, is a story all her own.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>In the game, Vivian breaks away from the villainous Shadow Sirens and her sisters Beldam and Marilyn to join Mario as his fifth party member. In the original Japanese version of the game and some foreign translations, Vivian’s gender varies.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>In the American version of the game, she’s described only with feminine pronouns. Over on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cutting Room Floor</a>, we can get a better sense of how that worked. The Japanese version of the game describes Vivian as: “A former member of the Shadow Trio. He may look like a girl, but he’s actually a boy.”</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>The English version says “Vivian suffers from a bit of inferiority complex” and attempts to sidestep that altogether.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>The French and Spanish versions say “He pretends to be a girl, but is actually a boy.” The German version doesn’t mention it in the description, and the Italian version was perhaps the most progressive: “She used to be a man, but now she’s a woman and proud of it.”</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>In Goombella’s tattle, in the English version, she’s described as “the youngest of the three Shadow Sirens.” The Italian is the same. The French version calls her “The youngest sister… I mean, brother.”</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=116 data-injectable=false>In Spanish it’s “She’s the smallest of the trio… Well… HE’S the smallest.”</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>To summarize: Japanese/Spanish/French lean more toward cross-dressing, Italian is proudly trans and English and German get rid of the references altogether.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>With this remake, Nintendo has a chance to present Vivian as she is, not censor her. People are hopeful this could be the case. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One X user pointed out</a> that the computer in the trailer had a red eye, not green, which is what it was in the Japanese version, meaning that maybe more will carry over.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>However, Japan leaned more toward cross-dressing but the argument is that maybe they will correctly portray Vivian this time.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>“Interesting note about the TTYD trailer: TEC’s ‘eye’ is red, not green. The green was a change made in versions outside of Japan. It being red in this trailer could imply other elements from the Japanese version will be brought back MEANING, trans Vivian internationally canon.”</p><p data-characters=19 data-current-count=19 data-injectable=false>People love Vivian!</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>Vivian is actually not the first trans character in a Nintendo game. In September 1998, Nintendo released the sequel to the original Super Mario Bros. game and introduced a character named Birdo, one of the first trans characters in any video game.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>In the instruction manual for the game, Birdo is described as “a boy who wants to be a girl.” The game also mentioned that Birdo preferred to be called Birdetta. However, Nintendo has never officially commented on the matter.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Was Birdo’s trans representation meant to be mockery? It may have been, but in the years since, Birdo stands out as a positive step toward equal trans representations in video games, as well as a fan favorite. It remains to be seen how Nintendo handles Vivian, but it’s a great opportunity to move forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8%2Bap56qXaKus7XOZquhnV2ptbDB0pqlnWWpmq6zecOopqtlopq6or%2FTnqlmpaWowW7AwKScZqyYmnqwvM%2Boqa2tnp7BunnTqGSfoahirm59mGawnpmiYrytsIycnKern6fAqbXPZqSiq6SWuKZ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kamani-johnson-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Arkansas Razorbacks' Kamani Johnson?
