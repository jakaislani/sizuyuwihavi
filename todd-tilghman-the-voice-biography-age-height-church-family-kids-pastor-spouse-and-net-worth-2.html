And we have eight kids. Two are adopted.”</p><p>Then, he continued “The biggest running joke in our family is that my wife said she wanted three kids, and I wanted two, so we compromised on eight…After we had the three boys, I just began to feel the pull of adoption.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“In 2010 is when we flew to Korea to get [our daughter] Judah. You know, when I saw her, it was just, like, this instant connection, like, ‘This is our child.’ And then we had a phone call from the adoption agency, and they told us Judah had a baby sister born from the same biological mother. We just said yes. And then after that, we had three more!.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=todd-tilghman-net-worth></span>Todd Tilghman Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Todd has not revealed his net worth.
