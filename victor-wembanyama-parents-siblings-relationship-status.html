During his first preseason game on Oct. 9., the 19-year-old Frenchman scored 20 points with a full arsenal of eye-catching plays.</p><p>Wembanyama is a 7-foot-4 big man with the ball-handling and shooting abilities of a guard. He is truly a generational talent who will surely be a game-changer for coach Gregg Popovich and the Spurs.</p><p>Wembanyama first began playing professionally in 2019 and now led the French top flight in numerous categories, including points, rebounds, and blocks. This kid is the real deal and has had NBA scouts drooling for years over his unique skillset. It's truly remarkable what he can do on the court.</p><p>So, where does Wemby's athleticism come from? In this piece, we'll take a look at his entire family, including his parents, siblings, grandparents, and even his relationship status.</p><h2><strong>Parents</strong></h2><p>Sports are evidently in Wembanyama's blood. His father is a native of Congo and actually ran track and field when he was younger. While Felix never participated in the Olympics, he was reportedly a long jumper, high jumper, and triple jumper. Wemby has even <a href=# rel=noopener>credited his father</a> for teaching him how to properly jump and run.</p><p>Now, over to the basketball routes. the mother of Victor Wembanyama, Elodie de Fautereau, played professionally before becoming a youth coach. She introduced the big man to basketball at a young age after he initially played soccer and judo. He couldn't help but lace them up and hit the court given the roots of the game:</p><p>“I mean, I had the choice and I still have the choice to play or not play basketball, but basketball has always been around,” Wembanyama says. “I can’t avoid it in my family.”</p><h2><strong>Grandparents</strong></h2><p>Reports indicate that both grandparents of Wembanyama were involved in basketball. Michel de Fautereau played in the French top division for a club out of Paris and stood 6 foot 7. Marie Christine meanwhile “drove him to games” and was also a player, per SLAM.</p><h2><strong>Siblings</strong></h2><p>It runs in the blood, right? Wemby's sister, Eve Wembanyama, is a 21-year-old professional in the second division of the French basketball system for a club out of Monaco. She helped the U16 France squad win the FIBA World Championships back in 2017. She stands at 6 foot 1.</p><p>Could we have another Victor Wembanyama in the future? Well, he has a brother named Oscar who is just 15 and already playing at the pro level for Nanterre, the same club Wemby started his career out with. Oscar first played handball <a href=# rel=noopener>before following suit</a> of others in his family and stepping on the hardwood, according to Benoit Dujardin of ProBallers.com. Maybe he could be an NBA prospect in a few years, too?</p><h2><strong>Relationship status</strong></h2><p>For the time being, Wembanyama is a single man. Not totally surprising since he is just 19 and has just moved across the world to begin his NBA journey.</p><p>As you can see, the basketball bloodlines run deep for Victor Wembanyama. The rookie sensation will make his NBA regular-season debut on Oct. 25 against the Dallas Mavericks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnKrBpLTPqKCnrKNjsLC5jq%2BgnKyfp3q4scybmKexkaKubrzAq5ynrKNiwKquy6KloKtdp7KtrdOipqermJ69br%2FTmquuqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./grilledpizza.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Grilled Summer Herb Garden Pizza</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-the-veil-in-harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is the Veil in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
