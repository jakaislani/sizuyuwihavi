A medicinal analyst decided that Thomas’ demise was an aftereffect of manslaughter, with hypothermia as a significant contributing element.</p><p>The kid’s mom Justyna Zubko-Valva disclosed to CrimeOnline that it was her 10-year-old child Anthony who was in the carport with Thomas that night. The mother said she has been conceded brief care of Anthony and his 6-year-old sibling Andrew.</p><p>The New York Post checked on records demonstrating that New York state’s Office of Children and Family Services got a protest in February 2019 about presumed maltreatment at the home.

As a result, according to Zubko-Vavla, her ex-husband was granted full custody of the children.</p><p>Zubko-Valva said she had made numerous complaints to multiple agencies over the years about her suspicions that her husband was abusing her children. She said when she attempted to file a police report with the Suffolk County Police Department, “they just laughed at me.”</p><p>According to the New York Post, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Geraldine Hart said that authorities attempted to perform at welfare check at the residence in May 2019, but no one was home. The report does not indicate that authorities made a second attempt.</p><p>Thomas’s grieving mother now says she wants to ensure that no other children suffer the way hers did, and is willing to share the documentation of her many attempts to intervene on behalf of her sons “if we can save the life of other children.”</p><p>“I could not understand they protected the abuser of children,” she said. “They did absolutely nothing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyYpLqiv4yvmKWukah6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqO1zqCpmqiYrnqnrcKtZJyZopqys3nAsJirnKNirq%2BwjKWgn51dqMGwvtho</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-a-breast-bud-in-a-girl.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is a breast bud in a girl?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eliza-coupe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eliza Coupe Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
