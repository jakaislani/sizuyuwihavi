He shares the same parents with his younger sister named Makena.</p><p>Lautner has claimed to have “distant” Native American lineage through his mother, specifically the Odawa and Potawatomi, two Anishinaabe peoples. He also claims to have Dutch, French, and German ancestry.</p><p>He was raised in Hudsonville, MI, a city close to Grand Rapids. He has said that because he was an actor, he experienced bullying in school.</p><p>At the age of six, he enrolled in his first karate lesson. A year later, Michael Chaturantabut, the creator of Xtreme Martial Arts, was introduced to him when he was at the national karate competition in Louisville, Kentucky.</p><p>Until his sophomore year, he attended Valencia High School in Santa Clarita, California, which is a public institution. In addition to playing football and baseball for his school, Lautner combined karate and acting with learning jazz and hip-hop dance.</p><p>When that got old, Lautner and his family made the decision to spend a month in California to see how they liked it before relocating to Santa Clarita, California, in 2002.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taylor Lautner career</h2><p>Following small roles in comedies like The Bernie Mac Show (2003) and My Wife and Kids (2004), Lautner went on to voice characters in shows like What’s New, Scooby-Doo?

When it was released in September 2011, critics had nothing but bad things to say about it, and Lautner’s performance received a lot of flak.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/08151148/image-228-1024x576.png><p>He starred in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn films, the last installments of the Twilight series, which were released over a two-year span from 2011 to 2012.</p><p>Later, Lautner worked on Grown Ups 2 with Chris Rock and Adam Sandler.
