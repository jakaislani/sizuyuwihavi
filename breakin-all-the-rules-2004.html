He's depressed, anyway; his fiancee Helen Sharp (<a href=#>Bianca Lawson</a>) has just broken up with him. He starts writing versions of a wounded, angry letter to her and somehow the correspondence grows into a book titled <i>Break Up Handbook,</i> about how to break up with a girl before she can break up with you (danger signal: She says she "wants to have a talk").</p><p>Enter Quincy's cousin Evan (Morris Chestnut), a moving target who prides himself on breaking up with girls as a pre-emptive strategy. His girl Nicky (Gabrielle Union) says she wants to have a talk, and to deny her the opportunity of breaking up with him, Evan sends Quincy to a bar to meet her and tell her the relationship is over. Alas, Nicky has cut her hair and doesn't fit Evan's description; Quincy starts talking with her, and soon they're flirting with love. If the hair trick sounds contrived, recall that Shakespeare was not above mistaken identities even more absurd. Not that I hold it against him.</p><p>Gabrielle Union is one of those actresses whose smile is so warm, you hope the other characters will say something just to make her happy. As a counterbalance, the movie supplies Rita (<a href=#>Jennifer Esposito</a>), a mercenary man-trap who wants to get her hooks into Philip the editor. Quincy is called in as a consultant on this case, too, but Rita is too crafty to be easily fooled by tricks learned from a book.</p><p>There will of course be a scene of wounded betrayal, when Evan discovers that Quincy is dating Nicky and decides he loves her after all. And a titanic battle of the wills between Rita and Philip. And jokes about being the author of a best seller; Quincy's book seems to hit the charts within days after he finishes it, having apparently been printed by magic.</p><p>"Breakin' All the Rules" is not a comic masterpiece, but it's entertaining and efficient, and provides a showcase for its stars. It's on the level of a good sitcom.</p><p>It's unusual in this way: Writer-director <a href=#>Daniel Taplitz</a> has come up with a magazine title that would probably work on the newsstands, and a book idea that would probably sell.</p><p>Most magazines in movies are completely implausible (in "13 Going on 30," the heroine redesigned the magazine as a school yearbook). And most best sellers in the movies sound way too good to ever sell many copies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bqZ6Zm567bq3LpWStoJViv7a4xKxka2hgaQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./everything-you-need-to-know-about-ken-jeongs-daughter-zooey-jeong.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everything You Need To Know About Ken Jeongs Daughter, Zooey Jeong</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-pretzels.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Best Pretzels, Ranked [Official Taste Test]</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
