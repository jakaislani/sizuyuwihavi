The movie doesn't identify President Ballentine (<a href=#>David Rasche</a>) as belonging to either major party, although somehow his wife Sarah (<a href=#>Kim Basinger</a>) looks to me like a Democrat. She also looks like a dish, and is having a passionate affair with, yes, Agent Garrison.</p><p>As the movie opens, another agent is shot dead, after telling Garrison he wanted to talk to him. Did he know something about an assassination attempt? Garrison thinks so, after meeting with a seedy informer who tells him there is a mole in the Secret Service -- a turncoat agent on the White House detail, who will set up the president for assassination. That this informer would know the secrets involved in this particular conspiracy seems unlikely, but then Clay Shaw never seemed like a likely suspect either, maybe because he wasn't one.</p><p>Without describing too many plot details, I can say that every agent assigned to the office of the president is required to take a lie detector test, and that only Garrison flunks. We know why: Asked if he has done anything to endanger the president, he naturally thinks of what he has done to endanger the president's marriage, and the needle red-lines. That makes him a suspect, and brings him into the cross-hairs of David Breckinridge (<a href=#>Kiefer Sutherland</a>), an ace investigator who used to be Garrison's best friend, until, uh, Garrison might have had an affair with <i>his</i> wife.</p><p>With the entire Secret Service looking for him, Garrison busts loose, goes underground, and uses all of his skills as an agent to stay free while trying to contact his informer and singlehandedly stop the plot to kill the president. A deadline is approaching, because Ballentine is scheduled to attend a summit in Toronto, where he might be a prime target. Since the presidential helicopter was shot down by a rocket while leaving Camp David a few days earlier (not with the president on board), and since the Service knows it has a traitor, you might think the wise decision would be to skip Toronto and stay at home, maybe in a Panic Room. But no: Ballentine goes to Toronto, along with Garrison, Breckinridge, Sarah, the terrorists and everybody else in the plot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lo5q7tbXNnqNmamBlgw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-warhammer-40k-factions-ranked.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All Warhammer 40K factions, ranked</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./neal-cassady.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Neal Cassady</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
