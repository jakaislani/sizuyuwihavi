People either love it or hate it, and there isn’t much gray area.</p><p>That has always seemed strange to me considering that it literally just tastes like mild cheese with a bit of a tang, but hey, some people just can’t deal with “textures” of any kind. I’d hate to be there when they discover sandpaper exists (jk, if you hate cottage cheese you’re totally valid; I just can’t relate). But as much as I and many others in this world love cottage cheese, I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that we don’t reeeeally know what it is. But that changes today!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-what-is-cottage-cheese>So what is cottage cheese?</h2><p>Is it cheese you eat in a small house (with a mouse)? Is it actually not curds but a bunch of tiny houses made of cheese? Is it girls wearing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">braids and flowery sundresses</a> frolicking through a meadow&nbsp;near&nbsp;a tiny house? Fun fact: It is actually none of those things. Y’all, and I can’t stress this enough,&nbsp;cottage cheese is just cheese. Literally. Here’s how cottage cheese is made, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Healthline</a>: “Cottage cheese is made by adding an acid to milk, which causes the milk to curdle. Then, the curd is drained and crumbled to make the final product.” And here is how other cheese is made, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Washington Post</a>: bacteria are added to milk which “digest the milk sugar (lactose), producing lactic acid as a result. Lactic acid causes the casein to curdle, or separate into lumps.” The only differences are that conventional cheese has the addition of bacteria, and you would then take curds and smush them together into one wheel or cube, and sometimes age it a little. So next time your friend who “loves cheese but hates cottage cheese” tries to yuck your yum, just be super annoying and explain to them that cottage cheese is just a socially acceptable way to eat lots of lil cheese curds with a spoon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-but-why-is-cottage-cheese-even-a-thing-who-half-made-some-cheese-and-then-decided-you-know-what-i-literally-cannot-wait-until-this-is-actually-finished-cheese-to-eat-it-and-then-dug-in-with-a-spoon>But why is cottage cheese even a thing? Who half made some cheese and then decided, “You know what, I literally cannot wait until this is actually finished cheese to eat it,” and then dug in with a spoon?</h2><p>Cottage cheese is believed to have originated around the same time as cheese. This makes sense because cottage cheese is kind of just an earlier stage in the cheesemaking process. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The legend goes</a> that Mesopotamians stumbled on cheesemaking back in the third century B.C.E. by filling sheep-stomach saddlebags with milk for traveling purposes. The heat of the desert plus the constant sloshing around of the milk in the bags, combined with the set of enzymes known as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rennet</a> from the sheep stomach, caused the formation of the cheese curds, which would eventually become the cheese curds we know and love today. Historians can’t necessarily confirm that’s the way it went down, but it does make a whole lot of sense. As for why it is called “cottage” cheese? It’s just because it was cheese that people could (and did) make in their cottages.</p><p>In conclusion, it may look like white barf to you, but cottage cheese is truly just a very simple cheese that was once made in cottages, sometimes with some cream added back to it to make for a creamier eating experience. And if thinking of it like that still makes you leery of cottage cheese, fine. But if I have opened you up to wanting to try it again, I highly recommend trying it out with some savory stuff. Try it on Lay’s potato chips with some smoked salmon and chives, or spread on some bread with a bit of caramelized onion and salt, or add it to buttered noodles to make an old Block family recipe called “noodles and cottage cheese.” You won’t be disappointed. Here is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sporked’s list of the best cottage cheeses</a> if you’re cottage curious, and I whole(milk)heartedly agree with these rankings. That <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Culture</a> stuff is so good it has me&nbsp;(cottage)cheesin’ every time I buy it.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmmqispJa0pnnCoZyeq5Vk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emilia-jones-biography-age-family-boyfriend-movies-brimstone-locke-key.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emilia Jones Biography, Age, Family, Boyfriend, Movies, Brimstone, Locke &amp;amp; Key</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./olivier-martinez-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Olivier Martinez Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
