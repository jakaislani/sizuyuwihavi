The hour-long film pays homage to old variety shows, and, with many famous people singing Christmas <a href=# class=T3D>songs in</a> <a href=# class=T3D><i>A Very Murray Christmas</i> </a>, it's the perfect way to geek out over your favorite hip celebs. (Especially Bill Murray, because he is the hippest of them all.) While most of the songs are Christmas standards that you can easily listen to other versions of, <a href=# class=T3D>no official <i>A Very Murray Christmas</i> soundtrack is being released</a> by Netflix. But, never fear! This DIY-soundtrack gives you <a href=# class=T3D>all of the songs featured in </a><i><a href=# class=T3D>A Very Murray Christmas</a>, </i>and what time to find them at while you're watching on Netflix.</p><p>The special starts with Murray being upset that no one is able to make it to his live Christmas special due to a major blizzard, but what follows is something to bring Murray-followers joy (lots of celebs singing). So, get <i>A Very Murray Christmas</i> streaming and enjoy your unofficial Christmas soundtrack for the 2015 holiday season, brought to you by Murray and friends.</p><h3>"The Christmas Blues" — 00:14</h3><p>Murray sets the tone for the rest of the Christmas special with the depressing — yet jazzy — Dean Martin song "The Christmas Blues," accompanied only by Paul Shaffer on the piano. Besides Murray, Shaffer is the only true constant throughout the special.</p><h3>"Let It Snow" — 06:20</h3><p>It's only a tiny snippet of the classic song (you'll hear more of it later), but it's worth a listen since Amy Poehler and Julie White accompany Murray in "Let It Snow" as Shaffer plays the melodica and they all walk down the stairs.</p><h3>"Jingle Bells" — 10:58</h3><p>Another brief moment since Murray gets depressed performing the happy song without an audience to listen to him.</p><h3>"Do You Hear What I Hear?" — 14:25</h3><p>In the best Christmas <a href=# class=T3D>musical duet since Bing Crosby and David Bowie</a>, Murray — and a reluctant Chris Rock — sing "Do You Hear What I Hear?" in matching turtleneck sweaters and holly pinned to their chests ... that is until the power goes out and Rock escapes.</p><h3>"Baby, It's Cold Outside" — 19:08</h3><p>Murray moves to the bar after his show can't go on and Jenny Lewis (as a cocktail waitress) and Murray do their take on the mandatory male-female duet of Christmastime. Luckily, Murray's ad-libbing helps make it a tiny bit more interesting than usual. No wonder there were rumors <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>this pair was dating</a>.</p><h3>"Alone On Christmas Day" — 26:04</h3><p>After some failed attempts by other members at the bar of "The 12 Days of Christmas" (by Dimitri Dimitrov), "O Tannenbaum" (by David Johansen), and "Good King Wenceslas" (by Lewis), the French chefs sing "Alone On Christmas Day." The impromptu chef band happens to be Phoenix. (Lead singer <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Thomas Mars is married to the director</a> of the movie, Sofia Coppola). Murray joins in on <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the rare Beach Boys song</a> and Jason Schwartzman (<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Coppola's cousin</a>) plays the drums. You can actually <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>buy the official version of this song</a> if you so desire.</p><h3>"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)" — 29:44</h3><p>Usually I'm a fan of Maya Rudolph's vocals, but if there's one song to skip, I'd sadly say it's Rudolph's rendition of Darlene Love's "Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)." Although she does have a lot of attitude, the notes aren't all there, but it's still all in good fun.</p><h3>"I Saw The Light" — 34:02</h3><p>Schwartzman in the special is actually Christmas Eve groom Elliot with Jones as his bride. The pair is sad that they couldn't get married because of the blizzard, so Murray gets the couple to sing a song about love. (Even though I adore him, Schwartzman has sounded better in his band Coconut Records, but Jones' vocals are lovely.) Todd Rundgren's "I Saw the Light," isn't a Christmas song, but it brings everyone together, including Johansen, Rudolph, and Murray.</p><h3>"Fairytale of New York" — 37:50</h3><p>As Christmas Eve became Christmas, Johansen, Murray, and Lewis sing this favorite Christmas song of mine by The Pogues featuring Kirsty MacColl. Rudolph, Jones, Schwartzman, Dimitrov, and the rest of the bar join in as Murray appropriately slugs a drink down.</p><h3>"Sleigh Ride" — 41:29</h3><p>Murray passes out from one too many Christmas cocktails and wakes up to the dream version of how his <i>A Very Murray Christmas</i> should have been. Murray sounds great as he croons with the help of Miley Cyrus, who arrives on a sleigh with George Clooney.</p><h3>"Silent Night" — 43:56</h3><p>Cyrus, accompanied by only Shaffer on the piano, sings "Silent Night." And, after hearing a lot of actors-who-can-kind-of-sing (not you, Lewis!), Cyrus nailing the Christmas classic is more than welcome. This should definitely enter the Christmas radio rotation.</p><h3>"Santa Claus Wants Some Lovin'" — 46:58</h3><p>Murray, with his Santa Claus cape askew, sings Albert King's soulful "Santa Claus Wants Some Lovin.'" And when I had been convinced that Clooney was just going to be eye candy in the background, he popped his beautiful face from behind the white Christmas trees to back up Murray, showing he's got a tiny bit of <a href=# class=T3D>his aunt Rosemary's vocal skills</a>.</p><h3>"Let It Snow" — 49:42</h3><p>Murray gets a second, more epic, chance at "Let It Snow" with Cyrus, with soft backup vocals by Clooney and kick lines galore. Now, that's how you do a Christmas music special.</p><h3>"We Wish You A Merry Christmas" — 51:42</h3><p>When Murray awakes from his stupor, Shaffer and Dimitrov are still by his side (just as they were in the beginning). Murray's gloom has been lifted a tiny bit as he does a simple rendition of "We Wish You A Merry Christmas." And, when Bill Murray wishes you a Murray Christmas, you accept it with your whole heart — and start all over singing from the beginning again.</p><p><i>Images: Ali Goldstein/Netflix; Caitlin Gallagher/Bustle (13); </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>theverge</i></a><i>/Tumblr</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfpZraW5lpJ2ybsLEq7BmpaWnv6LFjJyfq6Gjqbqiv4yspq6mlKm%2Foq%2FKZpqapl2Xsm7Fzq6prGWkna6vt9Jmq6hlpJ22tHnDorBmq5%2BjtG6z1KKbng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stan-kroenke-wife-ann-walton-kroenke-net-worth-age-yacht-husband-instagram-foundation-young-ann-walton-kroenke.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stan Kroenke Wife: Ann Walton Kroenke Net Worth, Age, Yacht, Husband, Instagram, Foundation, Young A</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
