After a foreboding opening scene in which Tara appears terrified, “Tentacles” opens as a relatively straightforward relationship drama. After meeting at an open house, photographer Sam allows the mysterious Tara to fix up a house he owns and the two start dating, falling into a deep, all-consuming relationship quickly. They spend almost all of their time together, and Tara admits that she has a stalker who has terrified her into hiding. Of course, it’s pretty clear there’s more going on than a mere woman-on-the-run story and Tara has been keeping more than just a stalker from her new man. And that’s not just because of the shooting pains and blood coming from Sam’s ears. Tara seems to be literally physically impacting him.</p><p>“I wish there was some way to show you other than sex or talking—some way to touch brains.” In most episodes of “Into the Dark,” there’s a turning point, a moment in the film when it could really take off and become its best self. Here, in this line and the action around it, “Tentacles” threatens to become true Cronenberg-esque psychosexual body horror, to truly get into how passion can physically change us. And the film definitely deserves some credit for being more willing to go there in terms of sex and eroticism than most modern horror films, especially in this series. There’s almost always an interesting idea in every “Into the Dark,” and a journey of two people who become so obsessed with one another they ignore warning signs and spiral into a Lovecraftian nightmare? Sign me up.</p><p>Sadly, “Tentacles” never lives up to that potential. Also like too many episodes of “Into the Dark,” the ideas are half-baked and inconsistent. Instead of blending elements of romantic dramas and body horror, they kind of just bounce off each other, never producing a truly interesting hybrid. Part of the problem is that Sam and Tara are boring. They need to be intriguing people on their own who then lose their humanity in one another. Aranovich isn’t interested in these people like the best movies of this kind. (For something similar but far more effective, check out “<a href=#>Spring</a>.”) Drori and Deidrick are perfectly fine and actually have strong chemistry, but they’re just unengaging characters. Even worse, the imagery fails the piece's mood&nbsp;until the final act. If you’re going to give us a bland romantic drama, at least make the grisly fates of these bland people memorable. &nbsp;</p><p>It’s fun to have “Into the Dark” back. Plus, overall, season two was shaping up to be more ambitious and accomplished than the first. And there are certainly worse chapters than “Tentacles,” but it reminded me more of the "Into the Dark" films that needed a little more time in every phase of development—one more rewrite, a few more takes, a tighter edit. Let’s hope future installments find the time to consider more before jumping into their cinematic relationships.</p><p>Now playing on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46ipa2nXam1pnnDmqmkZaSau7WtwqWcrGWdpMOqsYyrnK%2Bhlax6c3yRag%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pitbull.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pitbull Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./atticus-mitchell.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Atticus Mitchell Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Amalia Yoo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-dogs-get-parvo-from-the-ground.html>How do dogs get parvo from the ground?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-many-licks-get-center-tootsie-pop.html>How Many Licks to Get to the Center of a Tootsie Pop: The Real Answer!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-grab-documentary-film-review-2024.html>The Grab movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jonathan-daviss-outer-banks-movies-dad.html>Jonathan Daviss; Outer Banks, Movies, Dad, Girlfriend, Height, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
